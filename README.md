### Course Description

This course will study theoretical aspects of prediction problems, where we seek to understand themathematical underpinnings of machine learning. A primary objective of the class is to bring students to the frontiers of research in this area. The course will cover, among other things, concentration inqualities, uniform deviation bounds, Vapnik-Chervonenkis Theory, Rademacher Complexity, margin bounds, boosting, generalization bounds for artificial neural networks, online learning theory and regret minimization. Along the way, we will dive into several related topics, including connections to convex optimization, minimax equilibrium in games, multi-armed bandit problems, calibration, sequential portfolio selection, option pricing, and differential privacy.

**Prerequisites:** Familiarity with the analysis of algorithms, probabilistic analysis, and several similar topics. CS7641 (Machine Learning) will be quite helpful but not strictly necessary. The material is going to be about 90% "theory" and thus potential students must have a strong mathematical background. We shall rely heavily on techniques from calculus, probability, and convex analysis, but many tools will be presented in lecture.

**Coursework:** There will be 4-5 problem sets, rest of the details will be added soon.

**Grade Breakdown:** TBA
